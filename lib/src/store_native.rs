//! Store - this is an in-memory store of Atomic data.
//! This provides many methods for finding, changing, serializing and parsing Atomic Data.
//! Currently, it can only persist its data as .ad3 (Atomic Data Triples) to disk.
//! A more robust persistent storage option will be used later, such as: https://github.com/TheNeikos/rustbreak
